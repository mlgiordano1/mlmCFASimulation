1. create a working toy simulation (sim.R file)
	a. generate data in Mplus and save to data folder with naming convention
	b. read each data file
	c. fit with each function
	d. edit MIIV function to use Huang decomp for Muthen

2. once toy simulation is up and running start to play with other things below


test the functions against the example/results in the Hox book

work on simulating data: use mplus (but it can't do skew?). Maybe simulate some from Mplus and then create a function which emulates this in R

learn how to use the computing cluster
